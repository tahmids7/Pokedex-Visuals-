# Pokedex: Visuals-Project

_______________________________________

This is a moreso visual project that showcases the skills for basic HTML, CSS and JS. This pokedex acts almost as a real pokedex, which is a device that is used to choose and display a pokemon that is already saved on your device.

_What can this pokedex do?_

* When the user launches the pokedex, the pokedex stays in the closed position. By clicking on the yellow triangle, the pokedex will open up, displaying the contents inside.

* The pokedex is split up into a left and a right side. On the left is a black screen which will display the pokemon, the name of the pokemon displayed underneath, a green RANDOM button what randomly selects a pokemon from the collection saved on the device, and 4 arrow  controls that can be clicked to help navigate and select what pokemon the user wants to click. 

* On the right side displays every pokemon saved to the pokedex with their corresponding names and pictures. The right side also allows for the user to manually move their cursor and select a pokemon, which will populate on the black screen on the left side. 

* Once the user is done with using the pokedex and has a pokemon selected, the user can close the pokedex by clicking on the blue circle at the top right corner of the pokedex, effectively saving which pokemon the user has selected, so that if the user were to open up the pokedex again, the pokemon they selected would be displayed in the black box.
